# A machine learning method based on the genetic and world competitive contests algorithms for selecting genes or features in biological applications



## Research problem
Proposed a two step algorithm with GA in the first step to select features and World competitive contests WCC [reference](r.4.md)
(in the second stage to select optimal features.


## Limitations of previous methods (check references in paper)
1. Filter methods : performance is lower
2. Wrapper mehods : do not emplloy state of the art
3. Ensemble : local optima problem
4. Hybrid models : need to combine algorithms properly
5. Hypothesis based : Good but have all previously mentioned limitations
6. Reviews : constitute good futre direction

## Methods 
1. For GA early stopping is used
2. For WCC some predetermined condition is specified.
3. Different datasets were used, with different number of features for each. ()
