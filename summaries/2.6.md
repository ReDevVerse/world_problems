# An automated workflow for MALDI-ToF mass spectra pattern identification on large data sets: An application to detect aneuploidies from pregnancy urine


## Proposees a workflow for spectral identification.

### File Preprocessing.
1) Performm baseline correction on spectral data. (5-degree polynomial curve, remove negative values))
2) Normalize with the maximum intensity.
3) Estimate local [noise](r.3.md) with 5-point . (Maximum absolute difference in amplitude of all possible windows with a 5-point sliding window.)
4) Savitzy-Golay filter for important ranges.
5) Key protein was identified by picking the peak in certain range. 
6) 





# Points to consider

1) What is the right way to get rid of negative values in baseline correction.
