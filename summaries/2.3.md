<li> The authors point out the application of RT-PCR and comment that its desirable given its minimal requirements to process.

<li> Limitations of previous methods: 1) Sample samples were included for training and testing.2) Samples with cross-reactive viruses were not included 3) There was only one reproducible peak (shows host reponse rather than the virus itself)

<li> MALDI MS has potential and can be used for viral detection.
