# A simpler method of preprocessing MALDI-TOF MS data for differential biomarker analysis: stem cell and melanoma cancer studies


Proposes a technique to contrast inter and intra subjet ariability.

Previous techniques limitations identified - Several steps, mathematical approaches, remove noise from data, compatibile with only low resolution data.




In protenomics, the uncertainity should be removed from the raw data.



## Methods

### Preprocessing
<ol>
<li> SpecAlign software - for data imputation and average spectrum calculation (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/21/9/2088/409142) - provides various settings that can be configured by the user. smoothening - savitzy golay filter
<li>  Used standard average function to crunch the spectrum size from 2.7mil to 95k m/z.
<li> Compare intensity of adjacent spectrum and assign 1 if increasing, 0 if decreasing. This was then used in constructing gaussian plot. (Basically by computing mean of the ones and zeroes)
<li> Standard scale peaks in each region. 
<li> 3000 peaks were identified.
<li> Problems with peaks : 1) Peak might contain multiple protein peptides. 2) Mass drifts 3) outliers











# Directions
<ul>
<li> This study standardizes peaks using median. But not using the callibrant. It would be nice to show that callibrant normalization is better.
