NORMALIZATION, BASELINE CORRECTION AND ALIGNMENT OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT MASS SPECTROMETRY DATA

# Main
<ol>
<li>Data: human prostate cancer SELDI TOF MS data

<li>Contribution : We show on these data that our global normalization by scaling helps in distinguishing between different cancer groups as well as between cancer and non-cancer groups.

<li>Method : Between to Within sum of squares ratio introduced by Fisher as well as visual inspection to illustrate the improvement brought by the normalization.
