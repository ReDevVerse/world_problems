NORMALIZATION, BASELINE CORRECTION AND ALIGNMENT OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT MASS SPECTROMETRY DATA

## Main
<ol>
<li>Data: human prostate cancer SELDI TOF MS data

<li>Contribution : We show on these data that our global normalization by scaling helps in distinguishing between different cancer groups as well as between cancer and non-cancer groups.

<li>Method : Between to Within sum of squares ratio introduced by Fisher as well as visual inspection to illustrate the improvement brought by the normalization.
</ol>

## Definitions
<ul>
<li> Dynamic Programming : Break a program into chunks and solve recursively https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming

## Methods
<ul>
<li> Uses DP to accumulate the pointwise alignment score in a pointer and minimize the score through backtracking.
<li> Morphological filter was used for signal smoothening . (Good for high throughput data and continuous data)
<li> Reason for normalization : To remove varying amounts of protein degradation and variation in instrument detector sensitivity.
<li> Normalize by dividing the area AUC of spectrum/ Average AUC over all spectra.
</ul>

## Results
<ul>
<li> Authors display the results by showing that the peaks can be easily identified after normalization.
