- Two main categories of CoVID-19 tests:

    - Molecular assays for SC2 detection - using PCR pr Nuclic acid hybridiation techniques. (for virus presence)

    - Serology and immunology assays - (for antibodies)



- SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, and since its entire genetic sequence was uploaded to the GLobal Initiative on Sharing ALL Influenza Data (GISAID) platform on January 10, 2020


- Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory - RT-PCR assay (TaqPath COVID-19
Combo kit) uses self-collected saliva samples, which is quicker and less painful than other sample collection methods, lowers the risks to healthcare providers, and may enable higher
volume testing.[1]


- In labratory RNA is converted into DNA - reverse transcriptase - DNA is amplified and observed until the viral cDNA is observed. Taqman repeats amplification for 40 times.

- RT-PCR disadvantages = expensive, require highly skilled personnel, might take upto days
