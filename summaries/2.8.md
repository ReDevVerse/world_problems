# A novel short-term high-lactose culture approach combined with a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry assay for differentiating Escherichia coli and Shigella species using artificial neural networks



# Methods :
1) Did not explain how they got their matrix size of 12350X12396.
2) Dimensionality reduction from 12396 to 2048 using isomap algorithm. (https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/dimension-reduction-using-isomap-72ead0411dec)
3) ANN only rox-auc plot is shown. No other results.
