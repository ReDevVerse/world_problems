# Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs using MALDI-MS


## Why ? Use ML with MauldiMS apparatus to detect covid

## Data
[Positive = 211, Negative = 151] -> Total = 362
-> Data from 3 labs, (total data was 362 and 2/3rds were taken from lab1)
-> Took the peak intensities only and have taken 88 peaks into record
-> PCA analysis shows clear distinction between positive and negatives in lab2,3 but lab1 has overlap. 



## Feature Transformations
<ul>
<li>information gain based</li>
<li>correlation based</li>
<li>Indicated that using no feature selection gave better accuracy</li>
<ul>



## Algorithms
6 algs -

SVM had better performance than random forest by a slight margin


## Evaluation
3-fold cross validation repeated 5 times



## Key points


Only one reproducable peak that indicated
